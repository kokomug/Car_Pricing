# Car Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about car sales. The dataset includes various attributes such as sales in thousands, price in thousands, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and more. The analysis aims to explore relationships between different variables, perform data cleaning, conduct hypothesis testing, and build predictive models.

### Installation

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("plotly", "gridExtra", "nortest", "ggplot2", "readr", "caret", "caTools", "htmltools"))




##Running the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter notebook file (car_sales_analysis.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Ensure that you have R installed and configured with Jupyter.
Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially.
##Data Cleaning <a name="data-cleaning"></a>
The data cleaning process involves removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values. This ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis.

##Analysis and Visualization <a name="analysis-and-visualization"></a>
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand the relationships between different variables. Techniques such as scatter plots, summary statistics, and correlation tests are used to gain insights from the data.

##Hypothesis Testing <a name="hypothesis-testing"></a>
Hypothesis tests are conducted to determine the significance of relationships between variables. Tests such as the Anderson-Darling test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Shapiro-Wilk test are performed to assess normality. Chi-square tests are used to examine associations between categorical variables.

##Model Building <a name="model-building"></a>
Predictive models, such as linear regression, are built to understand the factors influencing car sales. Model performance is evaluated, and insights are derived from the results.
